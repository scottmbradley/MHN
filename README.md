# MHN

Which Honeypot(s) you deployed
mhn-honeypot-1-dionaea (2), mhn-honeypot-3-p0f, mhn-honeypot-4-elastichoney & mhn-honeypot-5-cowrie

Any issues you encountered
mhn-honeypot3-p0f has captured the most attacks, while the lastest one (cowrie) has only captured 1.  The (2) dionaea honeypots haven't captured any attacks.
I'm not sure why the (2) dionaea HM's haven't captured any attacks

A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.
The number of attacks captured are: 2442

Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected
I trying to see why the dionaea honeypots haven't captured any attack data
